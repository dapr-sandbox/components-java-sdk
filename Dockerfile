## protoc and gRPC helper binaries included with GRPC and ProtoBuf Gradle plugins
## are built against glibc. But Alpine linux uses musl - and this leads to all
## sorts of cryptic errors while trying to build .proto and gRPC stubs.
## The package `gcompat` adds a glibc compatibility layer that just solves the
## problem with minimal fuss. See
## * https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Running_glibc_programs
